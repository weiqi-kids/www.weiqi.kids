# The KataGo Era (2019-Present)

After AlphaGo retired in 2017, Go AI development didn't stop. On the contrary, the open source community took up the torch, making top-tier Go AI no longer the exclusive property of tech giants but a tool everyone can use. This "AI democratization" movement completely changed how Go is learned and trained.

## The Rise of Open Source AI

### Leela Zero: The Power of Community

In 2017, inspired by the AlphaZero paper, Belgian programmer Gian-Carlo Pascutto launched the **Leela Zero** project. This was a completely open-source Go AI with the goal of replicating AlphaZero's achievements.

Leela Zero's features:
- **Completely open source**: Code is public, anyone can participate in development
- **Distributed training**: Uses computers from volunteers worldwide for training
- **Starting from zero**: Uses no human games, learns entirely through self-play

After years of community effort, Leela Zero reached extremely strong playing levels, becoming one of the earliest popularized open-source Go AIs.

### ELF OpenGo: Facebook's Contribution

In 2018, Facebook AI Research released **ELF OpenGo**, another open-source Go AI based on AlphaZero architecture.

ELF OpenGo's significance:
- Provided complete training code
- Published pre-trained neural network weights
- Allowed researchers to make improvements on this foundation

### KataGo: The New Standard

In 2019, American programmer David Wu released **KataGo**, which quickly became the most popular open-source Go AI.

KataGo's innovations:
- **More efficient training**: Achieves stronger levels with fewer computational resources
- **More features**: Supports handicap games, different rules, win rate and score estimation
- **Better human-computer interaction**: Provides detailed analysis output
- **Continuous updates**: Regularly releases stronger neural network weights

Currently, KataGo has become the de facto Go AI standard, widely used for teaching, training, and research.

## The Significance of Open Source AI

### Democratization of AI Tools

In the AlphaGo era, only Google had top-tier Go AI. Ordinary players could only see AI's performance in news, unable to experience it personally.

Open source AI changed everything:

- **Everyone can use it**: Only needs an ordinary computer
- **Free access**: No fees required
- **Transparent algorithms**: Can understand how AI thinks

This is like going from "only professional photographers can take good photos" to "everyone has a high-quality camera in their pocket."

### Revolution in Go Education

Open source AI brought revolutionary changes to Go education:

**Instant feedback**
- For every move, AI can tell you if it's good or bad
- Can see the gap from "best play"
- Can explore different variations during review

**Personalized learning**
- Choose appropriate AI strength based on your level
- Targeted training on weaknesses
- Practice anytime, anywhere

**Objective evaluation**
- No longer dependent on subjective evaluations
- Can quantify your progress
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different moves

## AI's Influence on Human Playing Style

### The Joseki Revolution

After AI appeared, many traditional joseki were proven suboptimal, and new joseki constantly emerged:

**The 3-3 Revival**
- Traditional view: Invading 3-3 directly in the opening is "vulgar"
- AI view: In many situations, 3-3 is the most efficient choice
- Result: In modern games, opening 3-3 invasions have become normal

**Re-evaluation of Komoku Joseki**
- Many joseki passed down for hundreds of years were found not to be optimal
- New variations were developed
- Players need to constantly learn new variations

### Changes in Whole-Board Concepts

AI's playing style influenced humans' overall understanding of Go:

**Efficiency First**
- AI highly values efficiency of each move
- Traditional "thick" playing style is considered less efficient
- Modern players focus more on capturing territory

**Not Afraid of Complex Positions**
- AI isn't afraid of calculation, often enters complex fighting
- Human players also began more actively creating complex positions
- Intensity of games increased

**Precision in Late Game**
- AI's endgame and closing is very precise
- With AI help, human players' late-game ability significantly improved
- Half-point, quarter-point wins became more common

### New Forms of Creativity

Some worried AI would kill creativity in Go, but facts proved the opposite:

- AI showed many moves humans never thought of
- Players developed new tactics inspired by AI
- Human-AI "hybrid intelligence" created new possibilities

## How Modern Professional Players Use AI Training

### Daily Training

Modern professional players' training is inseparable from AI:

**Game Training**
- Play handicap games against AI
- Adjust AI strength to match own level
- Focus on specific position type practice

**Review Analysis**
- Use AI to review after every game
- Find mistakes and best moves
- Analyze win rate changes of different choices

**Joseki Research**
- Use AI to explore new joseki variations
- Verify if traditional joseki is still valid
- Develop preparation against specific opponents

### Match Preparation

AI has also changed how professional players prepare for matches:

**Opponent Research**
- Use AI to analyze opponent's game records
- Find opponent's weaknesses and habits
- Prepare targeted strategies

**Opening Preparation**
- Study AI recommended opening moves
- Prepare variations unfamiliar to opponents
- Gain advantages in opening phase

### Shin Jinseo's Example

Korean player **Shin Jinseo** represents the "AI generation" players. He has used AI for training since childhood, his playing style combining human creativity with AI precision.

Shin Jinseo's success shows:
- Early AI exposure can accelerate growth
- AI training doesn't replace creativity but enhances it
- The "AI generation" players' overall level is indeed higher

## Human-AI Coexistence

### AI as Tool, Not Opponent

After the initial shock, the Go world gradually found a way to coexist with AI:

- **AI is a teacher**: Teaching us better moves
- **AI is an assistant**: Helping us analyze and research
- **AI is a partner**: Showing us more possibilities in Go

Games between humans still have their unique value - emotion, psychological warfare, creativity, and things that can't be quantified.

### Go's Continued Development

AI didn't end Go but instead injected new vitality into this ancient game:

**Enhanced Viewing Experience**
- Viewers can see AI evaluation in real-time
- Easier to understand professional players' thinking
- Increased entertainment value of matches

**Lowered Entry Barrier**
- Beginners can get high-quality guidance
- Learning efficiency greatly improved
- More people can enjoy the fun of Go

**Overall Level Improvement**
- Average level of professional players improved
- Amateur players can also reach higher levels
- Go's "ceiling" keeps being pushed higher

## Looking to the Future

### Continuous Technological Progress

KataGo continues to update, each new version stronger than before. Possible future directions:

- More efficient training methods
- Better interpretability (telling humans "why" it plays this way)
- Combination with other AI technologies

### New Modes of Human-Machine Collaboration

In the future, the relationship between humans and AI may further evolve:

- **Human-machine pair Go**: Humans team up with AI to play
- **AI-assisted teaching**: More intelligent teaching systems
- **Go creation**: AI helps design interesting games or puzzles

### Continuation of Go Culture

No matter how technology develops, Go's core values won't change:

- It is training for thinking
- It is an aesthetic experience
- It is a way for people to connect

AI just lets us see this ancient game with new eyes, discovering beauty we never imagined.
