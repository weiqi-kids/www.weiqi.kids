# Opening Concepts

The opening (also called fuseki) is the first phase of a Go game. This phase determines the direction of the entire game. This article introduces basic opening concepts to help you develop proper whole-board vision.

## General Direction of the Opening

### Opening Objectives

The main objectives of the opening phase are:

1. **Claim key points**: Occupy high-value positions
2. **Establish bases**: Lay foundations for subsequent fighting
3. **Maintain balance**: Balance territory and influence

### Fundamental Go Principle

:::tip Corner, Side, Center
This saying explains the value of different board areas:
- **Corners** are most efficient (surround the most territory with the fewest stones)
- **Sides** are next in efficiency
- **Center** is least efficient

Therefore, in the opening, typically occupy corners first, then sides, and finally consider the center.

## Value of Corner, Side, and Center

### Why Corners Are Most Valuable

In corners, you only need two directions to form territory, making it most efficient.

| Area | Directions Needed to Surround | Efficiency |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Corner | 2 directions | Highest |
| Side | 3 directions | Medium |
| Center | 4 directions | Lowest |

### General Opening Sequence

1. **Occupy corners** (moves 1-4 approximately)
2. **Approach or defend corners** (moves 5-10)
3. **Claim sides or develop** (after move 10)

This sequence isn't absolute but reflects basic efficiency concepts.

## Common Opening Positions

### Star Point (4,4)

**Position**: 4 lines from each edge, marked with small black dots on the board.

**Characteristics**:
- Higher position, fast development
- Emphasizes outside influence
- Corner territory not very solid, may be invaded

**Suitable style**: Players who like fighting and emphasize influence

### Komoku (3,4 or 4,3)

**Position**: 3 lines from one edge, 4 lines from the other.

**Characteristics**:
- Balances territory and development
- Rich variations, many joseki
- Traditionally the most common opening position

**Suitable style**: Works for all styles

### San-san (3,3)

**Position**: 3 lines from each edge, the deepest corner point.

**Characteristics**:
- Directly secures corner territory
- Lower position, less outside influence
- Became more popular in the AI era

**Suitable style**: Players who emphasize territory and solid play

### Other Opening Positions

| Position | Coordinates | Characteristics |
|------|:---:|------|
| Mokuhazushi | 3,5 or 5,3 | Emphasizes development in one direction |
| Takamoku | 4,5 or 5,4 | Highest position, emphasizes outside influence |

## Basic Opening Concepts

### 1. Don't Be Too Greedy

In the opening, if you defend every corner too tightly, you'll let your opponent easily seize initiative. Learn to make trade-offs.

### 2. Maintain Balance

A good opening should balance:
- Territory (definite area)
- Influence (external power)
- Coordination between stones

### 3. Watch the Whole Board

During the opening, frequently look up to see the entire board:
- Where are the big points?
- What is the opponent trying to do?
- Are my stones coordinating well?

:::info Common Beginner Problem
Beginners often focus too much on local small fights and neglect big points elsewhere. Remember: in the opening phase, general direction is more important than small techniques.
:::

### 4. Speed vs. Solidity Trade-off

- **Playing fast**: Claim more big points, but each position is less solid
- **Playing solid**: Each position is very strong, but opponent may take big points

Neither style is absolutely better - it depends on the specific position and personal preference.

## Advice for Beginners

### Start with Small Boards

- 9x9 board: No traditional opening, suitable for practicing basic fighting
- 13x13 board: Has simple opening concepts, good transition
- 19x19 board: Full opening, requires more experience

### Simple Opening Choices

When first playing on 19x19:

1. Play one move in each of the four corners (occupy corners)
2. Use star points (4,4) for opening - simpler
3. Don't rush to learn complex joseki

### Observe Professional Games

Watch professional games and notice their openings:
- What positions they choose
- In what order they play
- How they evaluate big points

## Summary

Core opening concepts can be summarized as:

| Principle | Description |
|------|------|
| Corners before sides | Occupy efficient areas first |
| Trade-off balance | Can't be too greedy, must make choices |
| Whole-board vision | Frequently look at the entire board |
| Style choice | Find the approach that suits you |

There's no "standard answer" in the opening. As your skills improve, your understanding of the opening will continue to deepen. For now, the most important thing is to develop proper whole-board vision rather than memorizing many joseki.
