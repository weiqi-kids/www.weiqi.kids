# Go AI Evolution

## Why AI Changed Go

In March 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated world champion Lee Sedol 4:1. This match not only shocked the Go world but the entire world. Go, considered the last bastion of human intelligence, had finally been conquered by artificial intelligence.

But this wasn't the end - it was the beginning of a new era.

### Changes Brought by AI

**1. Redefining "Best Moves"**

Before AI appeared, humans had accumulated thousands of years of Go wisdom, forming what was considered "correct" play. However, AI's emergence overturned many traditional concepts:

- Openings are no longer limited to star point or komoku - the 3-3 invasion became mainstream
- "Forbidden" moves like early shoulder hits were re-evaluated
- Whole-board efficiency thinking replaced local joseki thinking

**2. Revolution in Learning Methods**

In the past, players needed decades to reach top level. Now:

- Young players can play against top-level opponents 24 hours a day
- Every move can receive objective numerical evaluation
- Reviews show the difference between best play and your actual moves

**3. Raising the Ceiling of Go Skills**

AI showed humans a higher level of Go:

- AlphaGo's win rate evaluation far exceeds human intuition
- Modern professional players' overall level has improved
- Games have become more exciting and deeper
