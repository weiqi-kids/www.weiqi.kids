# Ancient Go

Go's history can be traced back thousands of years to ancient China. It is one of humanity's oldest board games. Beyond being an intellectual game, it carries deep cultural significance, reflecting the essence of Eastern philosophy in concepts of yin-yang, balance, and strategic thinking.

## Chinese Origins

### Legend: Emperor Yao Creates Go

The most widespread origin legend is "Yao created Go to teach his son Danzhu."

Legend says over four thousand years ago, Emperor Yao's son Danzhu had a violent temper and was idle and unlearned. To teach him thinking and patience, Emperor Yao created the game of Go. Though this legend cannot be verified, it reflects ancient people's emphasis on Go's educational function.

Another legend attributes Go's creation to Emperor Shun, similarly to educate his son Shangjun. These legends all indicate one fact: in Chinese minds, Go has been closely linked to education and character cultivation from the very beginning.

### Earliest Written Records

Go's earliest reliable written records appear during the Spring and Autumn period. The "Zuo Zhuan" records:

> "Now Ning Zi looks at the ruler, not as well as a Go player planning his game."

This passage from 548 BCE shows that Go was already a well-known activity at the time, used as a metaphor for strategy and wisdom.

In the "Analerta," Confucius also mentions Go:

> "One who eats his fill all day and applies his mind to nothing - how difficult that is! Are there not game players? To do that would still be better."

Confucius believed that even playing games was better than idling. This reflects the society's attitude toward Go at the time - though not the most noble activity, it was still a worthwhile intellectual pastime.

## Spring and Autumn Warring States Period Development

### Yi Qiu: The First Go Celebrity

Mencius mentions the figure "Yi Qiu" in "Mencius, Gaozi Part 1":

> "Yi Qiu was the best Go player in the whole country. Having Yi Qiu teach two people Go..."

Yi Qiu is considered the first recorded Go master in Chinese history, and his story became the origin of the idiom "wholeheartedly devoted." This shows that by the Warring States period, Go had developed to the point of having professional experts.

### Go and Military Thought

In the era of the Hundred Schools of Thought, Go began to connect with military and political thinking. Go's concepts of offense and defense, encirclement, and trade-offs echoed strategic thinking in the art of war.

During this period, the Go board was not yet the modern 19x19 lines but the smaller 17x17. The evolution of board size reflects the continuous development of Go theory and technique.

## Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties Period

### The Golden Age of Go

During the Eastern Han, Ban Gu wrote "Yi Zhi" (The Meaning of Go), one of the earliest theoretical works on Go. The book expounded Go's philosophical significance, elevating it to the status of a "minor way."

During the Three Kingdoms, Go became even more popular. Many famous figures were Go enthusiasts, such as Cao Cao and Sun Ce. "Records of the Three Kingdoms" contains many Go-related stories.

By the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties, Go became an essential skill for scholars and literati, listed alongside qin (music), calligraphy, and painting as the "Four Arts." This period produced many famous players and more complete game record documentation.

### Evolution of the Board

According to archaeological discoveries, Han dynasty Go boards were mostly 17x17 lines. By the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the 19x19 board began appearing and gradually became mainstream. This specification has continued to the present day as Go's standard format.

## Transmission to Japan

### Transmission During the Nara Period

Go was transmitted to Japan around the 7th century (during China's Tang Dynasty). This was during Japan's Nara period, when large numbers of envoys traveled to Tang China to study, bringing Go along with other Chinese culture back to Japan.

Japan's Shosoin still preserves Go boards and stones transmitted from the Tang dynasty - precious historical artifacts.

### Entertainment for Nobility

Initially, Go in Japan was an exclusive activity for nobility and monks. Literary works from the Heian period, such as "The Tale of Genji," frequently feature scenes of nobility playing Go.

In Japan, Go was called "igo" (pronounced "go"), gradually developing a style and culture different from China. The Japanese viewed Go as a "way" (Go-do), emphasizing the spiritual cultivation and etiquette within it.

### Zen Buddhism and Go

With the spread of Zen Buddhism in Japan, Go developed a close connection with Zen practice. Many Zen temples became important centers for Go development, with monks experiencing the state of "emptiness" through playing Go.

This combination infused Japanese Go with unique spiritual content and laid the foundation for the later establishment of the Go house system.

## Transmission to Korea

### Transmission During the Three Kingdoms Period

Go's transmission to the Korean Peninsula may have been earlier than to Japan, around the 5th century (China's Southern and Northern Dynasties). At that time, the Korean Peninsula was in its Three Kingdoms era (Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla).

According to historical records like "Samguk Sagi," Go was quite popular among the nobility of the Korean Peninsula. Wall paintings in Goguryeo tombs also feature images of people playing Go.

### Go Development in Korea

In Korea, Go is called "baduk." Although Korean Go development in ancient times was not as flourishing as in China and Japan, Go has always been an important cultivation for Korean scholars.

During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), Go was quite popular among the intellectual class, but no professional system like Japan's developed. The true rise of Korean Go would wait until the latter half of the 20th century.

## Characteristics of Ancient Go

### Lack of Systematic Theory

Although ancient times already had many Go writings, compared to the systematic development of Japan's Four Houses era later, ancient Go theory was relatively scattered. Players mainly relied on personal talent and accumulated experience.

### Handicap Stone System

For a long time, Go games would begin by placing one black and one white stone on each of the four star points (called "seated stones"), and only then begin play. This system limited opening variations and was only abolished in modern times.

### Culture and Entertainment Combined

Ancient Go had the dual nature of cultural cultivation and leisure entertainment. It was both an elegant activity for scholars and literati and a pastime for common people.

Ancient Go established the deep cultural foundation for this game. However, the systematic development and professionalization of Go technique would truly begin only with Japan's Four Houses era.
