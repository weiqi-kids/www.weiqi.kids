## Guidelines for Using AI Analysis

### When to Use AI Analysis

**Appropriate times**:
- Reviewing after games end
- Studying variations of specific positions
- Checking if your judgments are correct
- Learning new move concepts

**Inappropriate times**:
- During a game (this is cheating)
- Before you've thought about it yourself
- Checking AI for every single move

### How to Use AI Analysis Effectively

#### 1. Review Yourself First

Before opening AI, first review the game yourself:

- Where were the turning points?
- Which moves am I unsure about?
- Which moves am I satisfied with?

Going to AI analysis with questions makes it much more effective.

#### 2. Focus on Big Mistakes

AI shows "win rate change" for each move. Prioritize:

| Win Rate Change | Meaning | How to Treat |
|:---:|------|------|
| > 10% | Serious mistake | Must study carefully |
| 5-10% | Clear mistake | Worth noting |
| 2-5% | Small mistake | Understand it |
| < 2% | Minor difference | Don't worry too much |

#### 3. Understand "Why"

Don't just look at what AI recommends, understand:

- Why is this move better than mine?
- What problems would my move cause?
- Can this concept apply elsewhere?

#### 4. Record Learning Insights

After analysis, record:

- What did I learn from this game
- What concepts need strengthening
- What to watch for in similar positions

## Avoiding Over-Dependence on AI

### Signs of Over-Dependence

If you have these situations, you may be over-dependent on AI:

- Must use AI analysis after every game or feel uneasy
- Start doubting all your own judgments
- Lost the joy of thinking for yourself
- During games, think "what would AI play"

### Why Avoid Over-Dependence

| Over-Dependence Problem | Explanation |
|----------------|------|
| Lost independent thinking ability | Don't know what to do in unfamiliar positions |
| Reduced learning effectiveness | Looking at answers without thinking, can't remember |
| Reduced playing enjoyment | Becomes a game of "seeking AI approval" |
| Affects actual game performance | No AI in tournaments, play worse |

### Healthy Usage Methods

:::tip Recommended Usage Principles

1. **Think first, then check answers**: Use AI to verify your thinking, not replace thinking
2. **Don't analyze every game**: Selectively analyze meaningful games
3. **Focus on concepts, not memorizing**: Learn the underlying principles, not specific sequences
4. **Preserve the pure joy of playing**: Sometimes just enjoy playing without thinking about analysis

| Correct Usage | Incorrect Usage |
