# Game Etiquette

Go is not just a contest of winning and losing, but also an expression of culture and refinement. Good game etiquette is fundamental to every Go player.

## Before the Game

### Greeting

- Before the game begins, greet your opponent: "Please teach me" or nod in acknowledgment
- If there are observers or teachers present, acknowledge them as well
- Confirm who plays Black or White (typically determined by nigiri)

### Nigiri (Determining Colors)

In formal matches, one player grabs white stones while the other guesses odd or even:

1. The higher-ranked (or older) player grabs a handful of white stones
2. The opponent puts out 1 stone (guessing odd) or 2 stones (guessing even)
3. Count the white stones; if guessed correctly, that player plays Black

## Stone Placement Etiquette

### No Take-Backs

**Once a stone is placed on the board, you cannot take it back.**

This is the most basic and important etiquette in Go. Even if you realize you made a mistake, you cannot ask to replay. This rule teaches us:

- Think before you play
- Take responsibility for your decisions
- Respect your opponent's time

:::caution Note
"Once your hand leaves the stone, it's final" - The moment your finger leaves the stone, that move is complete.
:::

### Handle Stones Gently

- Take stones from the bowl quietly
- Place stones on the board without making loud sounds
- Don't slam stones down on the board

### Proper Posture

- Sit upright, don't lean over the board
- Don't cross your legs or sit improperly
- Don't fidget with the stones

---

## Game Attitude

### Focus

- Concentrate on thinking during the game
- Don't leave your seat frequently
- Avoid doing things unrelated to the game

### Respect Your Opponent

| Should Do | Should Not Do |
|----------|------------|
| Wait for opponent to finish thinking | Rush your opponent |
| Stay quiet | Make distracting noises |
| Look at the board | Look around |
| Wait patiently | Show impatience |

### Stay Calm

- Don't show frustration when behind
- Don't gloat when ahead
- Don't get emotional over a single move

"Neither arrogant in victory nor dejected in defeat" - This is the most important life attitude that Go teaches us.

## Winning and Losing Etiquette

### How to Resign

When you believe there's no chance of winning:

1. Say "I resign" or "You win"
2. You may gently place a stone on the edge of the board to indicate resignation
3. Thank your opponent for the game

**Resignation is not shameful.** Being able to correctly assess the position and resign gracefully actually demonstrates both skill and character.

### Humility in Victory

When you win:

- Don't show obvious joy
- You may say "Thank you for the game"
- If your opponent has questions, you can kindly review together

### After the Game

- Regardless of the result, thank your opponent
- If time permits, review the game together
- Tidy up the stones

## Review Etiquette

Reviewing is a very important part of learning Go.

### Attitude During Review

- Humbly accept guidance
- When there are differing opinions, discuss calmly
- Don't argue about who's right or wrong; focus on learning

### Review Method

- Start from the beginning, replay the moves in order
- Stop at key points to discuss
- If time is limited, discuss only important turning points

## Online Game Etiquette

With the popularity of online Go, there are etiquette standards for online play as well.

### Basic Etiquette

| Item | Description |
|------|------|
| Opening greeting | Say hello when the game starts |
| Reasonable time use | Don't deliberately waste time |
| Prompt resignation | Resign promptly when the position is clear |
| Thank after game | Say thank you when the game ends |

### Things You Should Not Do

- **Escaping**: Disconnecting when losing
- **Stalling**: Deliberately using all time when clearly lost
- **Insulting**: Using chat to insult opponents
- **Cheating**: Using AI software to play for you

:::warning About Cheating
Using AI to play is a very serious violation. It not only deceives your opponent but also yourself. The joy of Go lies in the process of thinking for yourself; cheating abandons this joy.
:::

### Online Etiquette Reminder

- Remember there's a real person on the other side
- When typing to communicate, be friendly
- When encountering rude opponents, you can choose not to respond

## Spectating Etiquette

There are etiquette rules to follow when watching others play.

### Basic Principles

- **Stay quiet**: Don't make sounds that affect the players
- **Don't comment**: Even if you see good or bad moves, don't speak
- **Keep distance**: Don't get too close; give players space

### Online Spectating

- On platforms with chat functions, avoid discussing the current position
- Before the game ends, don't reveal position assessments

---

## Summary

The core spirit of Go etiquette is **respect**:

- Respect your opponent
- Respect the game
- Respect yourself

Good etiquette not only makes the playing experience more pleasant but is also part of preserving Go culture. We hope every player will develop elegant game manners while improving their skills.
