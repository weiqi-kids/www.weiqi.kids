- **KataGo Paper Analysis**: Understanding the innovative design of the current most advanced open-source Go AI
- **Other Go AI Introduction**: Comprehensive comparison of commercial and open-source Go AIs

### KataGo in Practice
- **Installation and Setup**: Building KataGo environment from scratch on various platforms
- **Common Commands**: Practical guide to GTP protocol and Analysis Engine
- **Source Code Architecture**: Deep exploration of KataGo's code structure and implementation details

## Who Should Read This

This section is suitable for the following readers:

| Reader Type | Recommended Content |
|---------|-------------|
| **Software Engineers** | Want to integrate Go AI into projects → Start with "Installation and Setup" |
| **Machine Learning Engineers** | Want to understand Go AI algorithms → Start with "AlphaGo Paper Analysis" |
| **Researchers** | Want to conduct Go AI research → Read all background knowledge then dive into source code architecture |
| **Go App Developers** | Want to develop Go-related applications → Focus on "Common Commands" and "Analysis Engine" |
| **System Administrators** | Need to deploy Go AI services → Focus on "Installation and Setup" chapter |

## Suggested Learning Paths

Based on your goals, we suggest the following learning paths:

### Path A: Quick Start (1-2 days)

For developers who want to quickly deploy KataGo:

1. [KataGo Installation and Setup](./katago-source/setup.md) - Set up the environment
2. [KataGo Common Commands](./katago-source/commands.md) - Learn basic operations

### Path B: Deep Understanding (1-2 weeks)

For engineers who want complete understanding of Go AI technology:

1. [AlphaGo Paper Analysis](./background-info/alphago.md) - Understand basic architecture
2. [KataGo Paper Analysis](./background-info/katago-paper.md) - Learn latest improvements
3. [Other Go AI Introduction](./background-info/zen.md) - Know the industry ecosystem
4. [KataGo Installation and Setup](./katago-source/setup.md) - Hands-on practice
5. [KataGo Common Commands](./katago-source/commands.md) - Deep dive into features

### Path C: Development Contribution (1+ month)

For those who want to contribute to KataGo open source or develop their own Go AI:

1. Complete all content in Path B
2. [KataGo Source Code Architecture](./katago-source/architecture.md) - Dive into the code
3. Read KataGo GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
4. Try modifications and experiments

## Prerequisites

To smoothly read this section, we recommend having the following background:

- **Programming**: Familiar with at least one programming language (Python, C++ preferred)
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Understanding of neural networks, backpropagation, and other basic concepts
- **Go Rules**: Know basic Go rules and terminology
- **Command Line**: Familiar with basic terminal operations

You can still read without these prerequisites, but may need to look up additional resources.
